Sup Jen? why you tryna talk to me?
You got baggage, I ain't getting lost in it
I see your man and how he trying to caution me
Don't get it started there ain't no stopping me

Sup Sharron? I like when you talk to me
Let's be friends but don't try to pop at me
I'm single free's my philosophy
You see drama but not in my glossary

I'm saying
Let's be friends don't wanna spell it out for ya
Let's be friends and keep things cordial
Let's make this smooth, I ain't the one for ya
So read my mind, let's just be friends

It feels like a few minutes ago I just met ya
I was doing my thing I didn't sweat ya
Yeah, you cute but that don't make ya special
Heard your story, plot had lots a textures
Okay, ya got my ear
I'm fully swayed, when I drop a tear
My time only costs a beer
Just kidding one minute let me stop here
Hey, whose this guy that's hovering over us
Grabbing ya shoulder like male chauvinist
"thats my man." Well, he's officially over us
Well good stories it was nice knowing ya
Good convo you're stronger than Oprah
Peace to you and ya man, I'mma jam
She gave me the look and grabbed my hand
I'll find you soon, don't leave the room man

9AM who the heck's texting me?
Rub my eyes.13 messages
Rub my eyes.13 messages
Hot damn! There's no second guessing it
The same girl with playful questioning
It's conversation but should I been caressing it
I know her man way back since fat crayons
Overall and shirts from silk rayon
Overall I know she wanna play on
But the more I resist the more she want liaison
Ain't it funny how we can be
Ain't it weird, when we don't see
But this time, its clear to me
Everything that she feel ain't what it seems to be
So...

I know I vibe with you
But this ain't right for you
We're stepping on toes
Let it all go
Even if I'm liking you
