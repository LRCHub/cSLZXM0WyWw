[02:19.10] 
[02:05.73] The night before, I realized inside my lonely heart
[02:09.46] As I'm watching petals fall into my open hands
[02:13.17] Our love is like a rose in bloom the beauty is just so fleeting
[02:16.20] I wish that we could stop the time together just this once
[02:45.20] 
[02:20.72] Remember now, it's there inside, the season that we met
[02:24.38] The gentle smile you gave to me still lingers in my head
[02:28.08] But it's time to let you go, it's a new page in our storybook
[02:58.58] 
[02:31.06] The days are past, our hearts were young,
[02:33.44] We were never meant to be
[02:45.94] 
[02:35.84] All of the promises we never ever meant to keep
[02:39.24] Nothing is changing, there's nothing to talk about
[02:42.67] Even though I love you, even though I need you,
[02:46.25] It's time for me to say
[02:57.75] 
[02:49.79] The rain the pours inside of my broken heart
[02:52.98] An emptiness that stretches forever inside of me
[02:57.23] I thought I knew what I'd be facing when you walk away
[03:00.76] But every inch of me's screaming against the pain that's inside
[03:32.26] 
[03:04.70] Now all these scars that remain between us,
[03:08.07] Unraveling the memories
[03:10.08] We tried so hard to forget
[03:12.31] Cause this could be the very moment we say our goodbyes,
[03:15.87] We take a step and try to move on, there is no turning back
[03:45.37] 
[03:35.60] Just one more time, I pray just more time,
[03:42.95] That if only I could return to those days
[03:46.74] I'd sacrifice everything that I have now,
[03:49.45] Just to feel the warmth of your smile again...
[04:12.45]
