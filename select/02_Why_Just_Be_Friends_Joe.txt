Sure baby we could be friends
Slow dance, romance, back rubs, hiked up slowly
That's us rolling in the meadow when we do it all

Slow dance, romance, back rubs, hiked up slowly
That's us rolling in the meadow when we do it all
Quite possibly we could be one
Just you and me so why just be friends?

And all you gotta do is take it off
(Take off your coat)
And all you gotta do is take it off
(That's what I wanna do)

And all you gotta do is take it off
(Baby kick off your shoes)
And all you gotta do is take it off
(Let's be more than just friends)

Girl just relax, I know we just started talking
Girl I can't help but to think of how we'd be
We could sail the seven seas like it was a dream
We could climb the highest mountain

If you know what I mean or just chill
And watch a movie or the TV
Baby you just got to trust I promise you'll see

Stop, drop your fears, baby come get with me
Give me your tears, I got the remedy
Take down your shield, I'm not the enemy
Girl I just wanna be the only one who can make you happy

Baby come close, I want to feel your body
Take it slow, ain't gotta follow nobody
We can't go wrong, baby just think about it

Sure baby we could be friends
Slow dance, romance, back rubs, hiked up slowly
That's us rolling in the meadow when we do it all

Slow dance, romance, back rubs, hiked up slowly
That's us rolling in the meadow when we do it all
Quite possibly we could be one
Just you and me so why just be friends

And all you gotta do is take it off
(That's what I wanna do)

And all you gotta do is take it off

And all you gotta do is take it off
(Let's be more then just friends)

I don't want to move you fast
But girl I'm ready, no pressure girl
Just sit back and let it in

If I'm rushing baby girl just let me know
It ain't no thing for me to take it slow
I ain't trying to make you feel uncomfortable
But I can't help feeling like you're the one I'm looking for

Stop, drop your fears, baby come get with me
Give me your tears, I got the remedy
Take down your shield, I'm not the enemy
Girl I just wanna be the only one who can make you happy

Baby come close, I want to feel your body
Take it slow, ain't gotta follow nobody
We can't go wrong, baby just think about it

Sure baby we could be friends
Slow dance, romance, back rubs, hiked up, slowly
That's us rolling in the meadow when we do it all

Now I know that love has failed you many times before
But I'm trying to make you see that the only one is me
So forget the other guys, you dated long ago
And just let your mind be free, let's be more then just friends

Slow dance, romance, back rubs, hiked up slowly
That's us rolling in the meadow when we do it all
